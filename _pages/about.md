I am a researcher at [INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/) in the MIA-Paris laboratory, working in statistics and machine learning. I mainly worked in computational statistics for inference of latent variable models. Recently, I'm also interested in physics-informed machine learning methods and their applications for inverse problems and generative modeling.

From 2020 to 2021, I was a postdoc at Ecole Centrale Lyon working with Yohann De Castro on learning mixture models with sparse regularisation on the space of measures. Prior to that, I completed my PhD on *high-dimensional data and graph clustering with discrete latent variable models* at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University, under the supervision of Pierre Latouche, Charles Bouveyron and Alain Livartowski.

## research interests:

- Physics-informed machine learning (PINNs)
- Latent variable models
- Variational inference
- Sparse regularisation
