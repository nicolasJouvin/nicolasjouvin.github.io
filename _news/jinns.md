jinns is a Python package for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) we develop together with [Hugo Gangloff](https://hgangloff.github.io/) as a basis for our research. Using the JAX ecosystem, it provides an intuitive and flexible interface for

 * forward problem: learning a PDE solution.
 * inverse problem: learning the parameters of a PDE.
 * meta-modeling: learning a family of PDE indexed by its parameters.

**Check out the documentation at** [https://mia_jinns.gitlab.io/jinns/](https://mia_jinns.gitlab.io/jinns/)

*Want to use or contribute ?* Development happens on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/mia_jinns/jinns)
